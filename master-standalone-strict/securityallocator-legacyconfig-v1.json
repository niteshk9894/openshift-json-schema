If this value is changed after startup, new projects may receive labels that are already allocated to other projects. Prefix may be any valid SELinux set of terms (including user, role, and type), although leaving them as the default will allow the server to set them automatically.\n\nExamples: * s0:/2     - Allocate labels from s0:c0,c0 to s0:c511,c511 * s0:/2,512 - Allocate labels from s0:c0,c0,c0 to s0:c511,c511,511",
