Using PROXY protocol enables the IngressController to report those source addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to the IngressController.  See http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt for information about PROXY protocol.\n\nThe following values are valid for this field:\n\n* The empty string. * \"TCP\". * \"PROXY\".\n\nThe empty string specifies the default, which is TCP without PROXY protocol.

If an external load balancer is configured to forward connections to this IngressController, the load balancer should use this port for health checks. The load balancer can send HTTP probes on this port on a given node, with the path /healthz/ready to determine if the ingress controller is ready to receive traffic on the node. For proper operation the load balancer must not forward traffic to a node until the health check reports ready. The load balancer should also stop forwarding requests within a maximum of 45 seconds after /healthz/ready starts reporting not-ready. Probing every 5 to 10 seconds, with a 5-second timeout and with a threshold of two successful or failed requests to become healthy or unhealthy respectively, are well-tested values.
