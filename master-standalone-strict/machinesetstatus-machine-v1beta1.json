Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.\n\nAny transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the controller's output.",
