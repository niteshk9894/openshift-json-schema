If the EgressIP node cannot be reached within this timeout, the node is declared down. Setting a large value may cause the EgressIP feature to react slowly to node changes. In particular, it may react slowly for EgressIP nodes that really have a genuine problem and are unreachable. When omitted, this means the user has no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 1 second. A value of 0 disables the EgressIP node's reachability check.",
