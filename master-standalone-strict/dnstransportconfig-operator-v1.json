The current default is \"Cleartext\". \"Cleartext\" - Cluster admin specified cleartext option. This results in the same functionality as an empty value but may be useful when a cluster admin wants to be more explicit about the transport, or wants to switch from \"TLS\" to \"Cleartext\" explicitly. \"TLS\" - This indicates that DNS queries should be sent over a TLS connection. If Transport is set to TLS, you MUST also set ServerName.
