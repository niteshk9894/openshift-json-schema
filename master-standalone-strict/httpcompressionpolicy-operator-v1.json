This list can be empty, in which case the ingress controller does not apply compression.\n\nNote: Not all MIME types benefit from compression, but HAProxy will still use resources to try to compress if instructed to.  Generally speaking, text (html, css, js, etc.) formats benefit from compression, but formats that are already compressed (image, audio, video, etc.) benefit little in exchange for the time and cpu spent on compressing again.
