  "description": "DataDisk specifies the parameters that are used to add one or more data disks to the machine. A Data Disk is a managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data. It differs from an OS Disk as it doesn't come with a pre-installed OS, and it cannot contain the boot volume. It is registered as SCSI drive and labeled with the chosen `lun`. e.g. for `lun: 0` the raw disk device will be available at `/dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0`.\n\nAs the Data Disk disk device is attached raw to the virtual machine, it will need to be partitioned, formatted with a filesystem and mounted, in order for it to be usable. This can be done by creating a custom userdata Secret with custom Ignition configuration to achieve the desired initialization. At this stage the previously defined `lun` is to be used as the \"device\" key for referencing the raw disk device to be initialized. Once the custom userdata Secret has been created, it can be referenced in the Machine's `.providerSpec.userDataSecret`. For further guidance and examples, please refer to the official OpenShift docs.",
