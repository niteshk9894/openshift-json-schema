Selecting -1 (i.e., auto) will result in a large value being computed (~520000 on OpenShift >=4.10 clusters) and therefore each HAProxy process will incur significant memory usage compared to the current default of 20000.\n\nSetting a value that is greater than the current operating system limit will prevent the HAProxy process from starting.\n\nIf you choose a discrete value (e.g., 750000) and the router pod is migrated to a new node, there's no guarantee that that new node has identical ulimits configured. In such a scenario the pod would fail to start. If you have nodes with different ulimits configured (e.g., different tuned profiles) and you choose a discrete value then the guidance is to use -1 and let the value be computed dynamically at runtime.\n\nYou can monitor memory usage for router containers with the following metric: 'container_memory_working_set_bytes{container=\"router\",namespace=\"openshift-ingress\"}'.\n\nYou can monitor memory usage of individual HAProxy processes in router containers with the following metric: 'container_memory_working_set_bytes{container=\"router\",namespace=\"openshift-ingress\"}/container_processes{container=\"router\",namespace=\"openshift-ingress\"}'.",
